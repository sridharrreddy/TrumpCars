### Tech Stack 
- ASP.Net MVC
- ReactJs.Net
- SignalR
- SQL Server

### How the stack works
- ASP.Net and SQL Server manage business logic and data of the game
- SignalR allows the clients to communicate with each other immediately (with server only having to worry about game state)
- ReactJs.Net refreshes the page as & when the game state change
